# mask2graph

**mask2graph** is a Python library for converting **binary segmentation masks** into **graph-based representations**.

The project focuses on extracting structured, topologically meaningful graphs from raster masks, enabling downstream analysis such as connectivity assessment, network statistics, and vector export.

This repository was initially created to support my master thesis. Alongside this repository a secondary repository was made to support the riverseg project. It is focused on extracting river extents from satellite imagery using deep learning techniques. It can be found here: [riverseg](https://github.com/mort607e/riverseg)
